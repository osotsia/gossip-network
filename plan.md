### Project 1: Decentralized Telemetry Gossip Network

This project demonstrates proficiency in Rust, asynchronous networking, applied cryptography, and the design of a simple distributed system, mirroring the core of the "decentralized, zero-trust" platform.

**Concept:**
Create a command-line application where multiple nodes can form a peer-to-peer network over QUIC. Once connected, each node generates simulated telemetry data (e.g., a random floating-point number representing power output) and broadcasts it to the network using a gossip protocol. Every message is signed by the originating node's private key.

**Key Features to Implement:**

1.  **Cryptographic Identity:** Upon first run, the application generates a long-term ED25519 key pair for the node and saves it to a file. This serves as the node's permanent identity.
2.  **Peer Discovery (Simplified):** Nodes discover each other via a hardcoded list of bootstrap addresses or a simple command-line argument (`./node --peer 127.0.0.1:5001`).
3.  **Secure P2P Communication:** Use the `quinn` crate in Rust to establish secure, peer-to-peer connections using QUIC. QUIC handles the transport security (TLS 1.3) automatically. The application layer must still verify the peer's cryptographic identity.
4.  **Data Gossiping:** Every few seconds, each node creates a small, signed data packet (e.g., `{"node_id": "...", "timestamp": ..., "value": 123.45, "signature": "..."}`). It sends this packet to a random subset of its connected peers. When a node receives a packet it hasn't seen before, it verifies the signature and forwards it to its own peers.
5.  **State Management:** Each node maintains a simple in-memory table of the latest telemetry value received from every other known node, preventing message replay and endless loops.

**Why It Builds Credibility:**

*   **Directly Relevant Tech:** Uses Rust, QUIC, and cryptographic primitives for identity and message integrity.
*   **Demonstrates Distributed Systems Thinking:** Shows an understanding of P2P networking, state replication, and resilience. A gossip protocol is inherently decentralized and robust to node failure.
*   **Simulates the Core Problem:** Mimics the core function of sharing authenticated data between trusted embedded devices on a grid.

**Relevant Rust Crates:** `tokio`, `quinn`, `rustls`, `ring` or `ed25519-dalek` (for signatures), `serde`, `rand`.

Yes, adding a Svelte frontend is a reasonable way to visualize the network's activity and demonstrate full-stack capabilities. However, a web browser cannot directly connect to a peer-to-peer QUIC network due to browser security sandboxing.

The standard architectural solution is to have one or more of the Rust nodes also act as a web server that provides a WebSocket endpoint. The Svelte application connects to this WebSocket to receive a real-time stream of the network's state.

Here is a breakdown of the required modifications and the implementation plan.

### **Architectural Modification: The Bridge Node**

Your system will now consist of two types of components:
1.  **Standard Gossip Nodes:** The command-line Rust applications that form the P2P network.
2.  **Visualizer Node:** One of the Rust nodes will have an additional feature enabled by a command-line flag (e.g., `./node --visualizer-addr 0.0.0.0:8080`). This node participates in the gossip network just like any other, but it also hosts a lightweight web server and a WebSocket for the frontend.

### **1. Backend Modifications (Rust Node)**

The visualizer node needs to aggregate network state and serve it.

**A. Add a Web Server and WebSocket:**
*   Use a web framework like `axum` which integrates seamlessly with `tokio`. It is modern, fast, and has excellent WebSocket support via the `axum::extract::ws` module.
*   Define two routes:
    *   A static file server route (`/`) to serve the compiled Svelte application.
    *   A WebSocket route (`/ws`) for real-time communication.

**B. Aggregate and Serialize Network State:**
*   The node already maintains a state table of all known peers and their latest telemetry. This is the data you need to visualize.
*   You will need a thread-safe way to share this state between your P2P networking task and the web server task. An `Arc<Mutex<...>>` or `tokio::sync::watch` channel is suitable for this.
*   When a client connects to the `/ws` endpoint, the server will send a full snapshot of the current network state. Subsequently, it will send smaller, incremental updates as new telemetry messages arrive via the gossip protocol.
*   Define a clear JSON structure for this communication. For example:

```json
// Initial state snapshot
{
  "type": "snapshot",
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "node-a-pubkey", "value": 123.4},
    {"id": "node-b-pubkey", "value": 456.7}
  ],
  "links": [
    {"source": "node-a-pubkey", "target": "node-b-pubkey"}
  ]
}

// Subsequent update message
{
  "type": "update",
  "id": "node-a-pubkey",
  "value": 124.5,
  "source_of_gossip": "node-c-pubkey" // Optional: for visualizing message flow
}
```

**Relevant Rust Crates:** `axum`, `tokio`, `tower-http` (for serving static files), `serde`, `serde_json`.

### **2. Frontend Implementation (Svelte)**

The Svelte app will connect to the WebSocket and render the network graph.

**A. Setup:**
*   Create a new SvelteKit project: `npm create svelte@latest my-visualizer`.

**B. WebSocket Client:**
*   In a Svelte component (e.g., `src/routes/+page.svelte`), establish a connection to the WebSocket endpoint in the `onMount` lifecycle function.
*   Create Svelte stores to manage the state received from the backend (e.g., a `writable` store for nodes and another for links).
*   The `onmessage` handler of the WebSocket will parse the incoming JSON and update the corresponding stores.

```javascript
// Example in a Svelte component
import { onMount } from 'svelte';
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

export const nodes = writable({});
export const links = writable([]);

onMount(() => {
  const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/ws');

  ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);

    if (data.type === 'snapshot') {
      const initialNodes = {};
      data.nodes.forEach(n => initialNodes[n.id] = n);
      nodes.set(initialNodes);
      links.set(data.links);
    } else if (data.type === 'update') {
      nodes.update(n => {
        n[data.id].value = data.value;
        // You could also add a temporary visual effect for the update
        return n;
      });
    }
  };

  return () => ws.close(); // Cleanup on component destroy
});
```

**C. Visualization:**
*   Use a library to render the network graph. Manually rendering a dynamic graph with SVG is complex. **D3.js** (specifically `d3-force` for a force-directed layout) is the industry standard and a highly valuable skill to demonstrate.
*   You can create a Svelte "action" to wrap the D3 logic, which makes it reusable and cleanly integrated with Svelte's reactivity.
*   The visualization should reactively update whenever the `nodes` or `links` stores change. Each node in the graph could be a circle displaying its ID and latest telemetry value. You could make a node or link flash briefly when it's involved in an update to visualize the gossip propagation.
